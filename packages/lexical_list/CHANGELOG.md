# Changelog

## 1.7.4

No library changes. The packages version in lockstep — they are one library
split for pay-for-what-you-use, not a set of independent projects — so this
release keeps the set on one version. See `lexical_core` for what changed.

## 1.7.3

**Backspace at the start of the first item leaves the list.** It had nothing
before it to delete, so the key did nothing and a list at the top of a document
was a trap with no keyboard way out. The item becomes a paragraph and the items
below it stay a list of their own; a *nested* item steps out one level instead,
the same ladder Shift-Tab and Enter on an empty item walk. Upstream's rule,
through the new `ElementNode.collapseAtStart`.

## 1.0.0

First stable release; semantic versioning applies from here.
Bullet, numbered and check lists, with Enter-to-leave and Tab-to-nest.

The entries below record how it got here.

## 0.1.0-dev.1

First development release. Node types verified as a fixed point against
fixtures generated from Lexical 0.48.0.

### Added

- `registerList`: Enter on an empty item leaves the list — without it there is
  no way out except the mouse — and Tab / Shift-Tab nest and un-nest.
- `ListItemNode.insertNewAfter`, continuing the list; a new check-list item
  starts unticked rather than inheriting the state above it.
